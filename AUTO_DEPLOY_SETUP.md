# üöÄ Auto-Deploy Configuration

This document describes the auto-deploy setup for the Telegram Bot Project.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Code Quality Issues
- **Fixed unused global variables** in `main_bot_railway_backup.py`
- **Fixed empty Procfile** - now contains proper start command
- **Improved code compliance** with linting standards

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- **Enhanced CI/CD pipeline** with proper Railway integration
- **Added deployment verification** with health checks
- **Created automated deployment script** (`auto_deploy.sh`)
- **Implemented comprehensive testing** for deployment configuration

## üîß Auto-Deploy Setup

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)

The project now has a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that:

1. **Tests the code** on every push/PR
2. **Runs security checks** 
3. **Performs integration tests**
4. **Automatically deploys** to Railway on main branch pushes

#### Required Secrets (Optional)
Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets for enhanced deployment:
- Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
- Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` with your Railway API token

### Manual Deployment

Use the automated deployment script:

```bash
# Make script executable (if not already)
chmod +x auto_deploy.sh

# Run auto-deployment
./auto_deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check Python environment
- ‚úÖ Verify dependencies
- ‚úÖ Run syntax and quality checks
- ‚úÖ Deploy to Railway (if CLI available)
- ‚úÖ Verify deployment health

## üìÅ Deployment Files

### Core Files
- `Procfile` - Heroku/Railway process definition
- `railway.json` - Railway-specific configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification

### Auto-Deploy Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `auto_deploy.sh` - Manual deployment script
- `tests/test_help_commands.py` - Deployment verification tests

## üåê Deployment Endpoints

After successful deployment, your bot will be available at:

- **Main App**: `https://telegram-bot-project-1-production.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: `https://telegram-bot-project-1-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **Metrics**: `https://telegram-bot-project-1-production.up.railway.app/metrics`

## üîç Monitoring & Verification

### Health Check Endpoint
```bash
curl https://telegram-bot-project-1-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Metrics Endpoint
```bash
curl https://telegram-bot-project-1-production.up.railway.app/metrics
```

### Railway CLI Commands
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check status
railway status

# Open app in browser
railway open
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment fails**
   - Check Railway service status
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check application logs

2. **Health check fails**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for service startup
   - Check Railway logs for errors
   - Verify BOT_TOKEN is correctly set

3. **Bot not responding**
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Verify Telegram bot token
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check syntax
python -m py_compile main_bot_railway.py

# Test imports
python -c "import main_bot; print('‚úÖ Imports working')"

# Run local tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Check deployment config
python tests/test_help_commands.py
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Commit and push** to main branch
3. **GitHub Actions** automatically triggers
4. **Tests run** (syntax, security, integration)
5. **Auto-deploy** executes if tests pass
6. **Verification** checks deployment health

## üìã Checklist for New Deployments

- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Railway project connected to GitHub
- [ ] Webhook URL updated (if needed)
- [ ] Bot token is valid and active
- [ ] Health endpoints respond correctly

## üéØ Next Steps

The auto-deploy system is now fully configured and ready to use. Every push to the main branch will automatically:

1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Perform security checks  
3. Deploy to Railway
4. Verify deployment success
5. Provide detailed status reports

Your Telegram bot will be automatically deployed and kept up-to-date with zero manual intervention required!
